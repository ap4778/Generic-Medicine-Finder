# Medicine-Substitute
The Generic Medicine Finder Application is a Java Swing–based desktop solution designed to help users quickly identify generic alternatives to branded medicines. As healthcare costs continue to rise and generic drugs become more widely accepted, this application provides an essential resource for individuals looking for affordable medication options.

The system offers an intuitive interface where users can enter the name of any branded medicine into a neatly designed rounded text field. After clicking the search button, the application connects to a MySQL database that stores detailed information about medicines and their generic equivalents. The results are presented clearly and include key details such as the generic medicine name, dosage, brand, price, chemical composition, and the accuracy of the suggestion.

To ensure reliability, the application includes strong input validation to prevent errors and guide users with meaningful error messages if the input is empty or invalid. When no matching medicine is found, the system alerts the user, maintaining a smooth and user-friendly experience.

The application also opens opportunities for future enhancements, such as advanced filters based on price, brand, or accuracy, and the ability to recommend similar medicines when an exact substitute is unavailable. These additions would further improve usability and support users in making informed decisions about their healthcare choices.

Overall, the Generic Medicine Finder Application aims to empower individuals by providing quick and easy access to essential pharmaceutical information. By simplifying the search for safe and affordable generic medicines, the project emphasizes the value of technology in improving healthcare accessibility, awareness, and cost management.
